# RedisGo #

### Motivation ###

I wanted to learn what redis was and how it was used. Coincidentally I also wanted to learn Go which has been becoming fashionable recently. So I decided to make my own in-memory db written in Go. I followed the book: [Build Your Own Redis in C/C++](https://build-your-own.org/redis/). 

### Notes ###
I would encourage others to do the project in a more low level language like C as you get to implement the Hashmap and AVL-tree data structures, and learn more about memory managment.
